The discourse so far has been extremely healthy and both sides bring valid points to the table. My comments will hopefully illuminate why we thought it was prudent to work with an MM as well as clarify some of the misconceptions that are being brought up.\n\nThe need for an MM quickly arose as I began speaking with a number of institutional investors here in Silicon Valley. While Decred isn’t yet a household name, most researchers who spent time looking into the project were quite intrigued and were quickly interested in becoming stakeholders. Time and time again, I heard issues around DCR’s liquidity. The inability to acquire a large position wasn’t the main deterrent, but rather the inability to get out of a position once acquired as well as what illiquidity said about market sentiment. Investors know many times markets are forced to contract, and when they do, the most illiquid assets behave poorly. Not because of fundamentals, but purely because the market can’t absorb the selling pressure. Similarly, investors have to weigh current liquidity in their research as a measure of sentiment and demand.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean that MMs are being brought in to help the wealthy, it is merely institutions who have been most vocal about the problem. The lack of liquidity affects investors big and small, and it seems like contracts are the most affected as they actually have to liquidate DCR to pay their bills. Not having liquidity + constant sell pressure from contractors and miners forces the price down and does not instill confidence within the broader market.\n\nAnother driving factor in our pursuit was the fact that an asset positioned to capture the SoV market needs liquidity. If an asset isn’t investable, I.e. liquid enough for investors to move in/out of, it can’t compete with other SoV contenders in the market. If you look back at Chris Burniske’s work on the institutional investors case for BTC, he notes that inevitability is one of the hall marks of any asset, and as such, we must prioritize DCR’s liquidity if we expect it to be an SoV. This issue is particularly exacerbated by the fact the DCR has such a high stake rate.\n\nIn terms of cost, something that should be stressed is that everything is malleable. Costs aren’t fixed, and we prompted the MMs to create proposals that were flexible so that stakeholders could decide the appropriate number of crosses, market depth, uptime, etc. $30,000 within 2% on each side seemed enough to facilitate retail investors moving in/out of positions with ease, but my understanding is that the MMs are willing to make this number $50k or even $15k, it all really depends on what we think is best.\n\nLastly, and we’ve stated this before, but all of the firms chosen to submit proposals are high quality firms with a lot of reputational skin in the game. For context, Altonomy just raised a large financing round from Polychain Capital, Grapefruit Trading was started by the former founder of Cumberland, and i2 has been a crypto OTC desk for a long time and active DCR stakeholder. We only engaged firms who’s values line up with those shared by DCR stakeholders.","signature":"63c5a6cbb007dcb409e0fef6c602082cb333378e2825c7f42721ff45c95957b948c006bd3e180f643da0eb4cb48fdb68beeae2d203a269799378b41c56eb7206","publickey":"80eb7299b7b47908d16b64b239ef9db30324440a425060c6622cabf06c594181","commentid":"1","receipt":"5b1d2c496c3ba96ecb3b340243c6ffbcf1b6da1a741e4ccf79ec71a462a2a99d4dbdf3d1c726727d41baaa54ee257d01c04dd05142a4fee4467bbfc5a2721a01","timestamp":1590675726,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
