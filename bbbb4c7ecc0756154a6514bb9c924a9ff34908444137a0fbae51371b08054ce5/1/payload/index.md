Underwater Decred Citadel

I have a team and a plan to build a Decred Citadel located in international waters of the Pacific Ocean.  It has the ability to float on the surface as well as submerse itself and sit on the ocean floor.  This will cost 10,000 DCR ($10,000,000,000 USD).  See attached renderings.
