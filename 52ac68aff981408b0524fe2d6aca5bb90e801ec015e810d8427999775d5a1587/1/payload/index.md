Decred Citadel - Dimension C-137

Big city with giant pyramids and city-towers half the height of Everest.

It's designed to be completely self-sustainable, running off-grid thanks to all-natural energy sources â€“ like wind and solar.

Current plans put the size at over 2.3-square-kilometres, with people living all along the terraced pyramid structure.e

It's expected to have an internal public transportation system that runs both horizontally and vertically, making cars redundant.

Construction is mooted to begin in 2021, with an estimated completion date of 2028.

Expected costs: $1 billion, about 10.000 DCR.
